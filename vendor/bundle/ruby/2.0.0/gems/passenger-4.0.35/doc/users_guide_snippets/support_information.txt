=== Supported operating systems ===

Phusion Passenger works on any POSIX-compliant operating system. In other
words: practically any operating system on earth, except Microsoft Windows.

Phusion Passenger is confirmed on a large number of operating systems and Linux
distributions, including, but not limited to, Ubuntu, Debian, CentOS/Fedora/RHEL,
Gentoo, Mac OS X, FreeBSD and Solaris. OpenBSD is supported since version 5.2.
Both 32-bit and 64-bit platforms are supported.
